# # Spiral Order

# Given a positive and odd integer `n`, return an `nxn` grid of integers filled as follows: the grid should have every number from `0` to `n^2 - 1` in _spiral order_, starting by going down from the center and turning clockwise.

# Example 1:
# n = 5
# Output: [[16, 17, 18, 19, 20],
#          [15,  4,  5,  6, 21],
#          [14,  3,  0,  7, 22],
#          [13,  2,  1,  8, 23],
#          [12, 11, 10,  9, 24]]

# Example 2:
# n = 1
# Output: [[0]]

# Example 3:
# n = 3
# Output: [[4, 5, 6],
#          [3, 0, 7],
#          [2, 1, 8]]

# Constraints:

# - `0 < n < 1000`
# - `n` is odd
